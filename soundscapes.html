    <h1>Soundscapes?</h1>
    <h3>What are they and how can they transport you?</h3>
    <hr />
    <div class="image-container">

      <p>
        The word Soundscape comes from sound and landscape. The word was first
        used by composer R. Murray Schafer to identify sounds that "describe a
        place, a sonic identity, a sonic memory, but always a sound that is
        pertinent to a place". In relation to mindfulness we can use sounds that
        are familiar or sentimental to relax us and inspire our minds to go to
        another place. There are so many distractions in the world now due to
        social media and many streaming tv and film sites that sometimes our
        eyes just need a rest from bright phone, tv and computer screens.

    <h2>How to find your Soundscape style</h2>
    <p class="text">
      It is hard to know what sound you find relaxing until you start listening
      to different types. You might find that environmental sounds such as rain
      pouring, waves crashing or a babbling brook send you into a state of calm.
      Or perhaps ambient and digitally produced music are better suited for your
      ears and mind. Below we have curated a variety of sounds for you to try
      and find which noises you have a connection to. Once you do... sit back,
      put your headphones on, and relax.

      <h2>Wash your worries away with the rain</h2>
      <p>
        The sound of rain meets many needs. It is meditative, helping you to
        concentrate and/or sleep. Rain also provides relaxation and calm,
        healing, comfort, and revitalization.

      <h2>Reach new levels with binaural sounds</h2>
      <p>
        Binaural beats arenâ€™t a music genre. They are an auditory phenomenon
        created by your brain in response to hearing specific tones in each ear.
        Early research of the experimental treatment indicates that listening to
        binaural beats can reduce feelings of anxiety and improve your ability
        to fall asleep.

      <h2>Take yourself to beach</h2>
      <p>
        Ocean sounds are the antithesis to the startling noises that trigger our
        threat responses. The slow ebbing and flowing of sea sounds are a
        naturally calming veil of noise that is soothing to the brain. Close
        your eyes and be taken to the seaside of your dreams, knocking away any
        of those holiday blues in sight.

      <h2>Bring the city life to you</h2>
      <p>
        Are you the type of person that loves to be social and go out but
        sometimes just needs a chill night in? Well wipe those FOMO fears away
        and listen to ambient background sounds from an array of locations such
        as coffee shops, restaurants and bars. These familiar sounds not only
        can help calm us but have also been noted to keep you focussed and aid
        concentration on work and tasks that you need to complete.
