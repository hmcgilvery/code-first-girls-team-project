<h1>Soundscapes</h1>
    <h3>What are they and how can they transport you?</h3>

      <p>
        The word Soundscape comes from sound and landscape. The word 
        was first used by composer R. Murray Schafer to identify sounds that "describe a place, a sonic identity, a sonic memory, 
        but always a sound that is pertinent to a place". In relation to mindfulness we can use
        sounds that are familiar or sentimental to relax us and inspire our minds to go to another place.
        There are so many distractions in the world now due to social media and many streaming tv and film sites that sometimes
        our eyes just need a rest from bright phone, tv and computer screens.

      <h3>How to find your Soundscape style</h3>
      <p>
        It is hard to know what sound you find relaxing until you start listening to different types. You might find that environmental sounds such as rain pouring, waves crashing or a babbling brook send you
        into a state of calm.
