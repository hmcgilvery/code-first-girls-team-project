        Losing a night's sleep or even more can really afect our mind and energy
        levels the next day. Having a good sleep hygiene is as important as
        eating healthy and exercising. Getting a good night's sleep has a lot of
        benefits, such as boosting your immunity, improving metabolism and
        mental health and reduces stress. However, it can be a little difficult
        to fall asleep when we have so many distractions in the bedroom:
        television, tablets and phones, or maybe the mind is just overwhelmed.
        Whether you have regular or occcasional sleep issues you can learn how
        to better manage your sleep by introducing some new healthy habits into
        your daily routine.

            <i class="fa fa-eye"></i>
            Practice being in the present moment. Check in with your 5 senses
            and ask yourself which are 3 things that you can see, hear, smell,
            touch and taste?
          </li>
          <li>
            <i class="fa fa-clock"></i>
            Stick to a sleep schedule- try to go to sleep and wake up at the
            same time every day. Being consistent tells your body when to be
            awake and when to feel drowsy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i class="fa fa-pen"></i>If your mind is racing at night try to get
            your thoughts on paper by journalling. You can write things you are
            grateful for.

          <li>
            <i class="fa fa-wine-glass"></i>Avoid having stimulants before bed

          <li>
            <i class="fa fa-tree"></i>Go for a walk every day. When you're out
            walking look around you and try to be present. Remember checking in
            with your senses.
          </li>
          <li>
            <i class="fa fa-bicycle"></i>Make time in your day for exercise,
            even if it is just for 30 minutes. Go for a walk, a bike ride or do
            a Yoga class.
