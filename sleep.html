        Losing a night's sleep or even more can really afect our mind and energy
        levels the next day. Having a good sleep hygiene is as important as
        eating healthy and exercising. Getting a good night's sleep has many benefits, such as boosting your immunity, improving mental health and reducing stress. However, it can be a little difficult
        to fall asleep when we have so many distractions in the bedroom:
        television, tablets and phones, or maybe the mind is just overwhelmed.
        Whether you have regular or occcasional sleep issues you can learn how
        to better manage your sleep by introducing some new healthy habits into
        your daily routine.

      <div class="sleep-container">

        <div class="column-left">
          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-eye"></i>Practice being in the present moment throughout the day. Set an alarm and check in with your 5 senses.
            Ask yourself which are 3 things that you can see, hear, smell,
            touch and taste?
          </div>
          <i class="fa fa-clock"></i>Stick to a sleep schedule- try to go to sleep and wake up at the same
          time every day. Being consistent tells your body when to be awake and
          when to be drowsy.
          <div class="step"></div>

          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-pen"></i>If your mind is racing at night, get your
            your thoughts on paper by journalling. Write things you are
            grateful for that happened during the day or in previous days.
          </div>

          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-wine-glass"></i>We truly are what we eat. Try to avoid having stimulants before bed
            time, such as alcohol, sugar and caffeine. Also try having a
            balanced diet and proper hydration.
          </div>

<div class="column-right">
          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-tree"></i>Go for a walk every day. When you are out look around you and try to be present. Remember checking in
            with your senses. Admire nature and be present. You will love it.
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-bicycle"></i>Make time in your day for exercise,
            even if it is just 30 minutes. Go for a walk, a bike ride or do
            a Yoga class. Any sort of physical activity helps us sleep better.
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-mobile"></i>Avoid taking your devices to bed and limit screen time 2

          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-spa"></i>Try to empty your mind before bedtime by doing some meditation or listening to some sleep music or even a sleep story. See below some useful videos.
