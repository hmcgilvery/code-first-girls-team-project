        Losing a night's sleep or even more can really afect our mind and energy
        levels the next day. Having a good sleep hygiene is as important as
        eating healthy and exercising. Getting a good night's sleep has a lot of
        benefits, such as boosting your immunity, improving metabolism and
        mental health and reduces stress. However, it can be a little difficult
        to fall asleep when we have so many distractions in the bedroom:
        television, tablets and phones, or maybe the mind is just overwhelmed.
        Whether you have regular or occcasional sleep issues you can learn how
        to better manage your sleep by introducing some new healthy habits into
        your daily routine.

        <div class="column-left">
          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-eye"></i>Practice being in the present moment throughout the day. Set an alarm and check in with your 5 senses.
            Ask yourself which are 3 things that you can see, hear, smell,
            touch and taste? 
          </div>
          <i class="fa fa-clock"></i>Stick to a sleep schedule- try to go to sleep and wake up at the same
          time every day. Being consistent tells your body when to be awake and
          when to feel drowsy.
          <div class="step"></div>

          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-pen"></i>If your mind is racing at night, get your
            your thoughts on paper by journalling. Write things you are
            grateful for that happened during the day or in previous days.
          </div>

          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-wine-glass"></i>We truly are what we eat. Try to avoid having stimulants before bed
            time, such as alcohol, sugar and caffeine. Also try having a
            balanced diet and proper hydration.

<div class="column-right">
          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-tree"></i>Go for a walk every day. When you're out
            walking look around you and try to be present. Remember checking in
            with your senses. Admire the nature and be present. Your mind will love it.
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-bicycle"></i>Make time in your day for exercise,
            even if it is just for 30 minutes. Go for a walk, a bike ride or do
            a Yoga class. Any sort of physical activity helps us sleep better.
          </div>
          <div class="step">
            <i class="fa fa-mobile"></i>Avoid taking your devices to bed and try to limit screen time 2
