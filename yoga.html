      <p>
        Yoga is a practice which connects the mind and the body through
        different poses, meditation and breathing techniques. It has a lot of
        benefits both for the mind and the body. Let's start with
        <em>the mind</em>. Yoga helps elevate your mood, improves your
        concentration, lowers stress and anxiety feelings and it decreases
        depression. Amongst some of the benefits for <em>the body</em> we can
        mention that Yoga stretches your muscles and improves your posture and
        core strength. When we coordinate movement with the breath and paying
        attention to the sensations in the body - Yoga becomes a mindful
        exercise. Train your mind and body to strenghten your mental and
        physical well-being by following the videos below.
