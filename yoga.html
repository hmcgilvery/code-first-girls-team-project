      <p>
        Yoga is a practice which connects the mind and the body through
        different poses, meditation and breathing techniques. It has a lot of
        benefits both for the mind and the body. Let's start with
        <em>the mind</em>. Yoga helps elevate your mood, improves your
        concentration, lowers stress and anxiety feelings, decreases depression
        and helps you focus on the present moment. Amongst some of the benefits
        for <em>the body</em> we can mention that Yoga stretches your muscles
        and improves your posture and core strength. When we coordinate movement
        with the breath and paying attention to the sensations in the body as we
        move, completely feeling the experience in that moment without any
        judgment or expectations, respecting our boundaries with self-compassion
        and kindness â€“ Yoga becomes a mindful exercise. Train your mind and body
        to strenghten your mental and physical well-being by following the
        videos below.
