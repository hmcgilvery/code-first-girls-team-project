        Yoga is a practice which connects the mind and the body through
        different poses, meditation and breathing techniques. It has a lot of
        benefits both for the mind and the body. Let's start with
        <em>the mind</em>. Yoga helps elevate your mood, improves your
        concentration, lowers stress and anxiety feelings and it decreases
        depression. Amongst some of the benefits for <em>the body</em> we can
        mention that Yoga stretches your muscles and improves your posture and
        core strength. When we coordinate movement with the breath and paying
        attention to the sensations in the body as we move, feeling the
        experience in that moment - Yoga becomes a mindful exercise. Train your
        mind and body to strenghten your mental and physical well-being by
        following the videos below.
