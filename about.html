        <em>Mindful Moments</em> is a page built for people who wish to learn
        how to take a moment and step away from daily stress, technology and
        distractions. We are here to create change in your life. We have put
        together a series of useful tips ranging from Yoga classes tailored to
        your needs, meditation practices, soundscapes, ways to deal with anxiety
        feelings and tips on how to have a more restful sleep. We hope all of
        this information will help people learn how to live a more happy
        authentic life and how to be in the present moment, rather than always
        connected to a device.
