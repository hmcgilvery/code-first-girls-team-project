      <h3>Tips to manage anxiety and stress</h3>
      <hr />

      <div class="image-container">

        <p>
          It’s normal to feel anxious sometimes. It’s how we respond to feeling
          threatened, under pressure or stressed: for example if we have an
          exam, job interview or doctor’s appointment. Anxiety isn’t necessarily
          a bad thing. It can spur us on, make us aware of risks and motivate us
          to solve problems. However, anxiety can be a problem if it’s affecting
          your life. This is where an emotional detox comes in. To address your
          anxiety you need to process it through an emotional detox. You can
          create this by taking daily breaks to connect with your body, ask your
          body how it feels, connect with the breath, activate joy by
          visualising images that represent calm and peace and also connect with
          your 5 senses.

      <h2>What are the symptoms of anxiety?</h2>
      <hr />
      <p class="text">
        Anxiety is known to affect your behaviour. You may withdraw from friends
        and family, feel unable to go to work, or avoid certain places. While
        avoiding situations can give you short-term relief, anxiety often
        returns the next time you’re in the situation. Avoiding it only
        reinforces the feeling of danger and never gives you a chance to find
        out whether your fears are true or not. Some people with anxiety may
        appear to be fine on the outside while still having symptoms such as a
        feeling of dread, feeling on edge and panicky, difficulty concentrating,
        irritability, restlessness, feeling dizzy, shortness of breath.

            <h4><i class="fa fa-bicycle"></i>1. Exercise</h4>
            <p>
              Jog, walk, bike, or dance three to five times a week for 30
              minutes. Make time in your day for any sort of exercise which will
              do wonders to your anxiety!

            <h4><i class="fa fa-clock"></i>2. Set small daily goals</h4>
            <p>
              Set small daily goals and aim for daily consistency rather than
              perfect workouts. It’s better to walk every day for 15-20 minutes
              than to wait until the weekend for a three-hour fitness marathon.
              Lots of scientific data suggests that frequency is most important.

            <h4><i class="fa fa-futbol"></i>3. Find fun forms of exercise</h4>
            <p>
              Exercise does not have to be a chore! Extroverted people often
              like classes and group activities. People who are more introverted
              often prefer solo pursuits.

            <p>
              If you don't like being in silence, listen to a podcasts, or music
              when you exercise. Many people find it’s more fun to exercise
              while listening to something they enjoy.

            </h4>
            <p>
              It’s often easier to stick to your exercise routine when you have
              to stay committed to meeting a friend or colleague. Exercising
              with someone else ca be loads of fun!

            <p>
              There is nothing wrong with feeling anxious. Try not to judge,
              tune into your body and breathe deeply through your nose and out
              through your mouth. Use your senses to bring your awareness back
              into the present.
