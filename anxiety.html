      <li>
        Jog, walk, bike, or dance three to five times a week for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set small daily goals and aim for daily consistency rather than perfect
        workouts. It’s better to walk every day for 15-20 minutes than to wait
        until the weekend for a three-hour fitness marathon. Lots of scientific
        data suggests that frequency is most important.
      </li>
      <li>
        Find forms of exercise that are fun or enjoyable. Extroverted people
        often like classes and group activities. People who are more introverted
        often prefer solo pursuits.
      </li>
      <li>
        Distract yourself with an iPod or other portable media player to
        download audiobooks, podcasts, or music. Many people find it’s more fun
        to exercise while listening to something they enjoy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Recruit an “exercise buddy.” It’s often easier to stick to your exercise
        routine when you have to stay committed to a friend, partner, or
        colleague.
      </li>
      <li>
        Be patient when you start a new exercise program. Most sedentary people
        require about four to eight weeks to feel coordinated and sufficiently
        in shape so that exercise feels easier.
