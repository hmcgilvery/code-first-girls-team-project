      <h3>What is mindful breathing?</h3>

        <p>
          The nature of breathing helps drive away distractions from your head.
          Mindful breathing is a calming practice but it isn't always easy to
          calm the mind and be in the present moment. Breathing changes with our
          emotions. We hold our breath when we are nervous or anxious and we
          take shallow breaths when we concentrate. When you align with your
          breath, you align with yourself through every emotion- this helps
          feeling calm, centred and less stressed. Our suggestion is to set time
          aside every day for breathwork. It's so easy to do and so versatile
          that you can do it anywhere: at a party, at home or even at work.

      <h2>Let's try an exercise together!</h2>
      <hr />
      <p class="text">
        Find a comfortable position - sitting in a chair, sitting upright or
        lying down. Close your eyes or lower your gaze and bring your awareness
        to the present moment. Look around you, scan the room and be aware of
        your surroundings. What can you see? What can you hear? Breathe in
        slowly through your nose and out through your mouth. When breathing in,
        let your stomach fill with air, then breathe all the air out through the
        mouth. It may help putting your hand on your stomach to help feel all
        that air coming in. Repeat for 5 times. Try to feel the breath in your
        own time, don't rush it. When you are done, open your eyes. How does it
        feel?

      <h2>The Wim Hoff breathing method</h2>
      <hr />
      <p class="text">
        Wim Hof breathing method is so simple everyone can do it! Always sit or
        lie down before practicing the techniques. Make sure you can expand your
        lungs freely without feeling any constriction. Close your eyes and try
        to clear your mind. Be conscious of your breath, and try to fully
        connect with it. Inhale deeply through the nose or mouth, and exhale
        unforced through the mouth. Fully inhale through the belly, then chest
        and then let go unforced. Repeat this 30 to 40 times in short, powerful
        bursts. After the last exhalation, inhale one final time, as deeply as
        you can. Then let the air out and stop breathing. Hold until you feel
        the urge to breathe again. When you feel the urge to breathe again, draw
        one big breath to fill your lungs. When you are at full capacity, hold
        the breath for around 15 seconds, then let go. This cycle can be
        repeated 3-4 times without interval.
