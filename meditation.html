        <div class="step1">
          <h5><i class="fa fa-couch"></i> 1. Get comfortable</h5>
          <p>
            Find a quiet place where you won’t be disturbed. Ideally this would
            be a room in your house where you can be alone and at peace.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step2">
          <h5><i class="fa fa-bed"></i> 2. Get in position</h5>
          <p>
            You might try sitting cross-legged on a low cushion on the floor, or
            upright in a chair. Some people prefer to meditate lying down.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step3">
          <h5><i class="fa fa-spa"></i> 3. Relax</h5>
          <p>
            Close your eyes, set a timer for five minutes if you are just
            starting out, and begin by taking a few deep, cleansing breaths.
            Breath in deeply (but naturally) through your nose, and out through
            either your nose or mouth—whichever feels more comfortable to you.
            Let the breaths flow all the way down into your abdomen.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="step4">
          <h5><i class="fa fa-heart"></i> 4. Focus on your breath.</h5>
          <p>
            Become aware of the sound of your breaths as you inhale and exhale.
            As you inhale, you breathe in all the peaceful and joyful things
            around you. As you exhale, you rid your mind and body of all the
            stress and toxins that have been bothering you. Let your mind become
            mesmerized by the rhythmic pattern of your breathing.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="column-right">
        <div class="step5">
          <h5><i class="fa fa-shoe-prints"></i> 5. Bring your thoughts back to center</h5>
   
            Your mind will wander. When you notice your thoughts wandering off
            from your breath, don’t chastise yourself—it’s totally normal.
            Simply acknowledge it and bring your focus back to the center, back
            to your breaths. Take in your immediate surroundings. What do you
            hear? What do you feel right now, at this moment? Try not to
            ruminate on the past or worry about the future, but be present in
            this pure moment.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step6">
          <h5><i class="fa fa-dumbbell"></i> 6. Make a committment</h5>
          <p>
            Like exercise, meditation takes practice. And the more we practice,
            the better we get and the stronger that mindfulness muscle becomes.
            Even just five to ten minutes per day has been shown to make an
            enormous difference to well-being after just eight weeks of
            meditation practice.
